"``AddAspNetIdentity`` requires as a generic parameter the class that "
"models your user for ASP.NET Identity (and the same one passed to "
"``AddIdentity`` to configure ASP.NET Identity). This configures "
"IdentityServer to use the ASP.NET Identity implementations of "
"``IUserClaimsPrincipalFactory``, ``IResourceOwnerPasswordValidator``, and"
" ``IProfileService``. It also configures some of ASP.NET Identity's "
"options for use with IdentityServer (such as claim types to use and "
"authentication cookie settings)."

"When using your own implementation of ``IUserClaimsPrincipalFactory``, "
