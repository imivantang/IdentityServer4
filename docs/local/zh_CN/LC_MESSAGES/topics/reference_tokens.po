"A JWT token would be a self-contained access token - it's a protected "
"data structure with claims and an expiration. Once an API has learned "
"about the key material, it can validate self-contained tokens without "
"needing to communicate with the issuer. This makes JWTs hard to revoke. "
"They will stay valid until they expire."

"When using reference tokens - IdentityServer will store the contents of "
