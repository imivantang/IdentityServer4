msgid ""
"A common architecture is the so-called federation gateway. In this "
"approach IdentityServer acts as a gateway to one or more external "
"identity providers."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:8
msgid "This architecture has the following advantages"
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:10
msgid ""
"your applications only need to know about the one token service (the "
"gateway) and are shielded from all the details about connecting to the "
"external provider(s). This also means that you can add or change those "
"external providers without needing to update your applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:11
msgid ""
"you control the gateway (as opposed to some external service provider) - "
"this means you can make any changes to it and can protect your "
"applications from changes those external providers might do to their own "
"services."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:12
msgid ""
"most external providers only support a fixed set of claims and claim "
"types - having a gateway in the middle allows post-processing the "
"response from the providers to transform/add/amend domain specific "
"identity information."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:13
msgid ""
"some providers don't support access tokens (e.g. social providers) - "
"since the gateway knows about your APIs, it can issue access tokens based"
" on the external identities."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:14
msgid ""
"some providers charge by the number of applications you connect to them. "
"The gateway acts as a single application to the external provider. "
"Internally you can connect as many applications as you want."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:15
msgid ""
"some providers use proprietary protocols or made proprietary "
"modifications to standard protocols - with a gateway there is only one "
"place you need to deal with that."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:16
msgid ""
"forcing every authentication (internal or external) through one single "
"place gives you tremendous flexibility with regards to identity mapping, "
"providing a stable identity to all your applications and dealing with new"
" requirements"
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:18
msgid ""
"In other words - owning your federation gateway gives you a lot of "
"control over your identity infrastructure. And since the identity of your"
" users is one of your most important assets, we recommend taking control "
"over the gateway."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:21
msgid "Implementation"
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:22
msgid ""
"Our `quick start UI "
"<https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI>`_ "
"utilizes some of the below features. Also check out the :ref:`external "
"authentication quickstart <refExternalAuthenticationQuickstart>` and the "
"docs about :ref:`external providers <refExternalIdentityProviders>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:25
msgid ""
"You can add support for external identity providers by adding "
"authentication handlers to your IdentityServer application."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:26
msgid ""
"You can programmatically query those external providers by calling "
"``IAuthenticationSchemeProvider``. This allows to dynamically render your"
" login page based on the registered external providers."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:27
msgid ""
"Our client configuration model allows restricting the available providers"
" on a per client basis (use the ``IdentityProviderRestrictions`` "
"property)."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:28
msgid ""
"You can also use the ``EnableLocalLogin`` property on the client to tell "
"your UI whether the username/password input should be rendered."
msgstr ""

#: ../topics/federation_gateway.rst:29
msgid ""
"Our quickstart UI funnels all external authentication calls through a "
"single callback (see ``ExternalLoginCallback`` on the "
"``AccountController`` class). This allows for a single point for post-"
"processing."
