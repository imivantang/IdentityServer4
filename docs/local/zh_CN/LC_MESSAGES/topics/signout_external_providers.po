"When a user is :ref:`signing-out <refSignOut>` of IdentityServer, and "
"they have used an :ref:`external identity provider "
"<refExternalIdentityProviders>` to sign-in then it is likely that they "
"should be redirected to also sign-out of the external provider. Not all "
"external providers support sign-out, as it depends on the protocol and "
"features they support."

msgid ""
"To detect that a user must be redirected to an external identity provider"
" for sign-out is typically done by using a ``idp`` claim issued into the "
"cookie at IdentityServer. The value set into this claim is the "
"``AuthenticationScheme`` of the corresponding authentication middleware. "
"At sign-out time this claim is consulted to know if an external sign-out "
"is required."

msgid ""
"Redirecting the user to an external identity provider is problematic due "
"to the cleanup and state management already required by the normal sign-"
"out workflow. The only way to then complete the normal sign-out and "
"cleanup process at IdentityServer is to then request from the external "
"identity provider that after its logout that the user be redirected back "
"to IdentityServer. Not all external providers support post-logout "
"redirects, as it depends on the protocol and features they support."

msgid ""
"The workflow at sign-out is then to revoke IdentityServer's "
"authentication cookie, and then redirect to the external provider "
"requesting a post-logout redirect. The post-logout redirect should "
"maintain the necessary sign-out state described :ref:`here <refSignOut>` "
"(i.e. the ``logoutId`` parameter value). To redirect back to "
"IdentityServer after the external provider sign-out, the ``RedirectUri`` "
"should be used on the ``AuthenticationProperties`` when using ASP.NET "
"Core's ``SignOutAsync`` API, for example::"

"Once the user is signed-out of the external provider and then redirected "
"back, the normal sign-out processing at IdentityServer should execute "
"which involves processing the ``logoutId`` and doing all necessary "
"cleanup."
