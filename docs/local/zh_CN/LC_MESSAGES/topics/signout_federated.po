"Federated sign-out is the situation where a user has used an external "
"identity provider to log into IdentityServer, and then the user logs out "
"of that external identity provider via a workflow unknown to "
"IdentityServer. When the user signs out, it will be useful for "
"IdentityServer to be notified so that it can sign the user out of "
"IdentityServer and all of the applications that use IdentityServer."

"Not all external identity providers support federated sign-out, but those"
" that do will provide a mechanism to notify clients that the user has "
"signed out. This notification usually comes in the form of a request in "
"an ``<iframe>`` from the external identity provider's \"logged out\" "
"page. IdentityServer must then notify all of its clients (as discussed "
":ref:`here <refSignOut>`), also typically in the form of a request in an "
"``<iframe>`` from within the external identity provider's ``<iframe>``."

"What makes federated sign-out a special case (when compared to a normal "
":ref:`sign-out <refSignOut>`) is that the federated sign-out request is "
"not to the normal sign-out endpoint in IdentityServer. In fact, each "
"external IdentityProvider will have a different endpoint into your "
"IdentityServer host. This is due to that fact that each external identity"
" provider might use a different protocol, and each middleware listens on "
"different endpoints."

#: ../topics/signout_federated.rst:16
msgid ""
"The net effect of all of these factors is that there is no \"logged out\""
" page being rendered as we would on the normal sign-out workflow, which "
"means we are missing the sign-out notifications to IdentityServer's "
"clients. We must add code for each of these federated sign-out endpoints "
"to render the necessary notifications to achieve federated sign-out."

msgid ""
"Fortunately IdentityServer already contains this code. When requests come"
" into IdentityServer and invoke the handlers for external authentication "
"providers, IdentityServer detects if these are federated signout requests"
" and if they are it will automatically render the same ``<iframe>`` as "
":ref:`described here for signout <refSignOut>`. In short, federated "
"signout is automatically supported."
