"MVC), the `back-channel <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-"

"To signout the user from the server-side client applications via the "

" an ``<iframe>`` to notify the clients that the user has signed out. "
"Clients that wish to be notified must have the ``FrontChannelLogoutUri`` "
"configuration value set. IdentityServer tracks which clients the user has"
" signed into, and provides an API called ``GetLogoutContextAsync`` on the"
" ``IIdentityServerInteractionService`` (:ref:`details "
"<refInteractionService>`). This API returns a ``LogoutRequest`` object "
"with a ``SignOutIFrameUrl`` property that your logged out page must "

"To signout the user from the server-side client applications via the "
"back-channel spec, the ``SignOutIFrameUrl`` endpoint in IdentityServer "
"will automatically trigger server-to-server invocation passing a signed "
"sign-out request to the client. This means that even if there are no "
"front-channel clients, the \"logged out\" page in IdentityServer must "
"still render an ``<iframe>`` to the ``SignOutIFrameUrl`` as described "

"Given how the `session management <https://openid.net/specs/openid-"

"special in IdentityServer that you need to do to notify these clients "
"that the user has signed out. The clients, though, must perform "
"monitoring on the `check_session_iframe`, and this is implemented by the "
"`oidc-client JavaScript library <https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-"

"If sign-out was initiated by a client application, then the client first "

"Processing at the end session endpoint might require some temporary state"
" to be maintained (e.g. the client's post logout redirect uri) across the"
" redirect to the logout page. This state might be of use to the logout "

"The ``GetLogoutContextAsync`` API on the :ref:`interaction service "
"<refInteractionService>` can be used to load the state. Of interest on "
