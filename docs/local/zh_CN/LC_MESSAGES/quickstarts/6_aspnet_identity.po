"IdentityServer is designed for flexibility and part of that is allowing "
"you to use any database you want for your users and their data (including"

"The approach this quickstart takes to using ASP.NET Identity is to create"
" a new project for the IdentityServer host. This new project will replace"
" the prior IdentityServer project we built up in the previous "
"quickstarts. The reason for this new project is due to the differences in"
" UI assets when using ASP.NET Identity (mainly around the differences in "
"login and logout). All the other projects in this solution (for the "
"clients and the API) will remain the same."
